# apptimetracker

An incredibly basic python app to track how long a specific application has been in use (based on windows open) and store it into a json file (stored in hours)

Runs a loop every 5 seconds and looks for the specified application

I made this to track how long it takes to read vns :sunglasses:

Change the targetted app in out.json (rerun app after change)
